Documentation for comprompt:

Comprompt is a work in progress command prompt that is meant to be simple and
easy enough for a 3 year old to understand, though still in development it is
usable and when it is done there will be a modified version for Adven.

How to use:

comprompt consists of two files, comprompt.h and misc.h, comprompt contains the
main input and output and a few inbuilt "demo commands" and misc.h contains
some misc stuff the about function which shows the version number and my name
and the help function which is still under development but will be completed
soon enough.

To mount it in your project you first need to create a infinite for loop and
#include "misc.h" like this:

#include "misc.h"

int foohack()
{
  for(;;)
    {
    }
}

Then a if else statement.

#include "misc.h"

int foohack()
{
  for(;;)
    {
      if (exitprompt == false)
        {
	}
      else
        return 0;
    }
}

And finally the one function we've all been waiting for! commandinput();

int foohack()
{
  for(;;)
    {
      if (exitprompt == false)
        {
	  commandinput();
	}
      else
        return 0;
    }
}

I also reccomend adding a system("clear"); and an about(); to make it better.
